# My Portofolio
This repository holds the code-base for my web portfolio.

:rocket: You can visit it at https://justantors.github.io/MyPortfolio/  :rocket:

It is built using [Deno](https://deno.land/) and [lume](https://lume.land/), an static web site generator for Deno. [Pico CSS](https://picocss.com/) is used to make the page nice to your eyes.

The page is deployed using GitHub Pages and a [custom workflow taken from the Lume webpage](https://lume.land/docs/advanced/deployment/#github-pages)
